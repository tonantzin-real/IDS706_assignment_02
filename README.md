### <ins>DATA</ins>

The data I chose is [**H-1B Employer Data Hub**](https://www.uscis.gov/tools/reports-and-studies/h-1b-employer-data-hub?utm_source=chatgpt.com), it comes from the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). This database includes:

> data from fiscal year 2009 through fiscal year 2025 (quarter 3) on employers who have submitted petitions to employ H-1B nonimmigrant workers. /
> The H-1B Employer Data Hub has data on the first decisions USCIS makes on petitions for initial and continuing employment.

More information about the dataset can be found [here](https://www.uscis.gov/tools/reports-and-studies/h-1b-employer-data-hub/understanding-our-h-1b-employer-data-hub).

 I selected the information from fiscal year 2018 until 2025 (Q3).
